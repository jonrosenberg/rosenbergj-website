                  <p> Conscious Fertility Cooperative was founded by a group of healthcare professionals passionately committed to
                    assisting women on their fertility journey. Their goal is to create a supportive network and an educational venue
                    that inspires and empowers women throughout all phases of their reproductive health. </p>
                  <h2>What will I gain from the retreat?</h2>
                  <p> The retreat is designed to create a comfortable space
                    for women undergoing fertility challenges. You will
                    learn self-care techniques from both Western and
                    Eastern philosophies.
                    Topics will include understanding your body’s natural
                    rhythms, nutrition and lifestyle, the biomechanical
                    affects of stress, and how to acknowledge your body’s
                    intuition. Included is a group acupuncture session. </p></td>
