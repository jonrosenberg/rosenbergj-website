          <p> Conscious Fertility Cooperative was founded by a group of healthcare professionals passionately committed to
            assisting women on their fertility journey. Their goal is to create a supportive network and an educational venue
            that inspires and empowers women throughout all phases of their reproductive health. </p>
          <h2>What will I gain from the retreat?</h2>
          <p> The retreat is designed to create a comfortable space
            for women undergoing fertility challenges. You will
            learn self-care techniques from both Western and
            Eastern philosophies.
            Topics will include understanding your body’s natural
            rhythms, nutrition and lifestyle, the biomechanical
            affects of stress, and how to acknowledge your body’s
            intuition. Included is a group acupuncture session. </p></td>
